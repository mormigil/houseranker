# House Ranker - Session Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
House ranking app using binary search comparison (like Beli). Users can share listings from Compass/real estate apps, manage multiple collections, and create different rankings within each collection.

## ✅ Recently Completed Features

### 1. Complete Ranking Management System
- **Multi-ranking support**: Each collection can have multiple rankings (e.g., "Main Ranking", "Weekend Picks", "Investment Properties")
- **Cross-page consistency**: Ranking selectors and creation available on all pages
- **Persistent state**: localStorage remembers current collection and ranking
- **Proper API filtering**: Backend correctly filters by collection_name and ranking_name

### 2. Fixed UI Issues
- **View Rankings page** (`/list`): Now properly filters by collection and ranking, includes management UI
- **Rank Houses page** (`/rank`): Shows ranking management even when no houses available to rank
- **Empty states**: All scenarios (no houses, first house, etc.) include ranking management options

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- Added `listing_url`, `collection_name`, `ranking_name` columns to houses table
- Proper indexing for performance
- Migration completed: `/supabase/migrations/002_add_collections_and_listing_url.sql`

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### Frontend Pages
- **Home** (`/`): Main navigation with API key management
- **Manage** (`/manage`): Add/edit houses, collection management
- **Rank** (`/rank`): Binary comparison ranking with ranking management
- **View Rankings** (`/list`): Display ranked lists with collection/ranking filtering

### Key Components
- **Collection Management**: Create/switch between collections (localStorage)
- **Ranking Management**: Create/switch between rankings per collection (localStorage)
- **API Integration**: Anthropic Claude for property description summaries
- **Share Target**: PWA manifest handles shares from Compass/real estate apps

### Backend API Routes
- `/api/houses` - CRUD operations with collection/ranking filtering
- `/api/ranking` - Binary comparison ranking with proper scope isolation
- `/api/share-target` - Handles PWA shares, extracts property data, LLM summaries

## 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Supabase PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API for property summaries
- **Storage**: Supabase for houses, localStorage for UI state
- **PWA**: Manifest with share_target for Compass integration

## 📊 Data Flow
1. **Share from Compass** → share-target API → property data extraction → LLM summary → manage page
2. **Add House** → houses API → database with collection_name
3. **Rank Houses** → ranking API → updates ranks within collection/ranking scope
4. **View Rankings** → houses API with filters → display ranked list

## 🎨 UI Features
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Dark/light mode support**: Tailwind CSS theming
- **Collection indicators**: Shows current collection and ranking on all pages
- **Listing URLs**: Clickable links to original property listings
- **Image optimization**: Next.js Image component with proper sizing
- **Form validation**: Duplicate detection, required field validation

## 🎯 Potential Next Features

### High Priority
- **Export functionality**: Export rankings to PDF/CSV
- **House comparison details**: Side-by-side feature comparison
- **Ranking analytics**: Stats on ranking patterns, time spent
- **Bulk operations**: Multi-select for batch actions

### Medium Priority
- **User authentication**: Move from localStorage to user accounts
- **Collaborative rankings**: Share collections with others
- **Advanced filters**: Filter by price range, location, features
- **Ranking history**: Track how rankings change over time

### Nice to Have
- **Map integration**: Show houses on map
- **Price tracking**: Monitor listing price changes
- **Notification system**: Alerts for new listings in area
- **Mobile app**: React Native version
- **Advanced AI**: Smart recommendations based on preferences

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently identified - ranking system is fully functional

## 📝 Development Notes
- **State Management**: localStorage for UI state, Supabase for persistent data
- **Ranking Isolation**: Each collection+ranking combination is independent
- **Share Integration**: Handles Compass URLs, extracts structured data, creates summaries
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback throughout
- **Performance**: Indexed database queries, optimized image loading
